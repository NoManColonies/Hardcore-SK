<description>A race of humanlike robots which are mostly female in model variety.

The origins of these machines are mostly unknown. Some speculate they are escapees from a civilization which used them for labor and some just suggest they are outdated pleasure machines which got dumped by a passing space freigher.

By design by their previous masters they are weak physically but their raw fortitude is enough to make up for it. Beware of their reactors violently exploding if they die by violent means or overheating.

Now you can discover and use the predecessors to Androids; the Droids. They are not much smarter than a improvised turret but they are relatively cheap to produce which make them easily replacable.
